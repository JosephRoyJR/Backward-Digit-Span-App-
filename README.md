This is a Backward Digit Span app which can be hosted locally without any modifications
- This is a Backward Digit Span App which can be hosted on a local system

- The R script named app.r is the major script. 

- Inorder to avoid confusion I suggest opening the R project which will open the folder 'bdslocal' as the directory 

- Then if you run the script with the required packages installed, it will load the shiny app. 

- The results of the test ie, the participant ID and level reached will be saved 
in the 'results.csv' file in the 'data' folder in the directory.
